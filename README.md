## Features
In this project I tried to add functionalities in a given social media ruby on rails app template:

- The back end is set up with User,post,comments, sessions and friendship models that validates presence of name,password,post,comments,likes and friendship. These models also contains different associations between each other.
- Devise gem was used in session authentication.
- If user check the page without being authenticated, he/she will not be able to see the home page or can use any functionalities.
- Any user who signed up and logged in can create their own post.
- Any user who signed up and logged in can send and accept friendship requests.
- Any user who signed up and logged in can delete and remove friendship requests.
- User show page displays post description with number of likes and with comments made by other users.
- User can give like to the posts of other users.
- User can see his or her list of users.
